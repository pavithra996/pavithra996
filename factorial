'''
Write a program to determine whether 'n' is a factorial number or not. Factorial of a number is the product of all positive numbers from 1 to 'n'.
Input format:
The input containing an integer 'n' which denotes the given number.
Output format:
If the given number is factorial, print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No".
Refer the sample output for formatting.
Sample Input:
6
Sample Output:
Yes
3) a = 0, b=0, c=1 are the 1st three terms. All other terms in the Lucas sequence are generated by the sum of their 3 most recent predecessors. Write a program to generate the first n terms of a Lucas Sequence.
Input format:
The input containing an integer 'n' which denotes the given number
Output format:
Print the  'n' terms of the Lucas Sequence, separated by a single space. There are no leading or trailing spaces in the output.
Refer the sample output for formatting.
Sample Input:
5
Sample Output:
0 0 1 1 2
